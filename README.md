# Kontagion
Alas! Plague has befallen the land. Livestock are dropping like flies and great urban centers are collapsing one-by-one. Not to worry, Socrates will save the day! In this arcade game, you play as Socrates Nguyen: a doctor shrunk down to fight against all the bacteria head to head. It is your job to defeat the disease before it defeats you!
